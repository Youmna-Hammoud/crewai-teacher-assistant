Lesson Topic: Introduction to Adjectives

Notes:
- Adjectives are words that describe nouns.
- They tell us about qualities such as size, color, shape, and feelings.
- Example: "The red apple" — 'red' is the adjective describing 'apple'.
- Adjectives can appear before nouns (attributive) or after linking verbs (predicative).
- Comparative adjectives compare two things (e.g., bigger, smaller).
- Superlative adjectives compare more than two things (e.g., biggest, smallest).
- Some adjectives are irregular (good → better → best).
