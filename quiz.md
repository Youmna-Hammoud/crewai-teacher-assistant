3. **Medium:**  Represent 3/5 visually using a rectangle. (Students would draw a rectangle divided into 5 equal parts, with 3 parts shaded.)
    * **Answer:**  A rectangle divided into 5 equal parts, with 3 shaded. This visually represents the fraction 3/5.


4. **Medium:** What does the numerator of a fraction represent?

7. **Hard:**  Explain why it's important that a whole is divided into equal parts when representing fractions.
