**Lesson Plan: Introduction to Fractions (45 minutes)**

**Topic:** Introduction to Fractions

**Grade Level:** 3-4 (adaptable)

**Learning Objectives:**

* Students will be able to define a fraction and identify its parts (numerator and denominator).
* Students will be able to represent fractions visually using diagrams.
* Students will be able to identify equivalent fractions.


**Materials:**

* Whiteboard or projector
* Markers or pens
* Fraction circles or squares (cut-out shapes divided into equal parts)
* Worksheet with fraction diagrams and problems (see example below)


**Lesson Procedure:**

**I. Opening (5 minutes)**

1. **Engage:** Start with a real-world example.  "Imagine you have a pizza cut into 8 slices. You eat 3 slices. How can we represent this using numbers?" (Allow brief discussion)
2. **Introduce:** Briefly explain that fractions represent parts of a whole. Introduce the terms "numerator" (the part we have) and "denominator" (the total parts).

**II. Teaching Segment (25 minutes)**

1. **Visual Representation (10 min):** Use fraction circles/squares to visually demonstrate fractions. Show 1/2, 1/4, 3/4, etc.  Emphasize that the denominator shows how many equal parts the whole is divided into, and the numerator shows how many of those parts are selected.  Draw examples on the board alongside the manipulatives.

2. **Defining Fractions (5 min):** Clearly define the terms fraction, numerator, and denominator. Use simple sentences and repetition to ensure understanding.  Write definitions on the board.  Practice saying the fractions aloud (e.g., "one-half," "three-fourths").

3. **Equivalent Fractions (10 min):** Introduce the concept of equivalent fractions using visuals.  Show that 1/2 is equal to 2/4, 3/6, etc., using fraction circles. Explain that equivalent fractions represent the same amount.  Emphasize the importance of dividing the whole into equal parts to form a proper fraction.


**III. Guided Practice (10 minutes)**

1. **Worksheet Activity:** Distribute worksheets with various diagrams representing fractions (circles, rectangles divided into parts). Students will identify the fraction represented in each diagram.  Include simple problems like: "Shade 2/5 of the rectangle." or "What fraction of the circle is shaded?"

2. **Class Discussion:**  Review answers together, clarifying any misconceptions. Discuss and explain any mistakes made.  Encourage students to explain their reasoning.


**IV. Closing (5 minutes)**

1. **Review:** Briefly summarize the key concepts of the lesson: what a fraction is, numerator, denominator, and equivalent fractions.
2. **Assessment:** Ask a few quick questions to check for understanding.  For example:  "What does the bottom number of a fraction tell us?" "Can you give me an example of an equivalent fraction to 1/3?"

**V. Optional Homework:**

* Students can draw their own fraction diagrams and label them with the correct fractions.
* They could also complete additional problems identifying equivalent fractions.


**Example Worksheet Problem:**

Draw a circle and shade in 3/4.  What fraction of the circle is not shaded?


**Differentiation:**

* **For students who need more support:** Provide more hands-on activities with manipulatives and one-on-one assistance.  Break down tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.

* **For students who are ready for a challenge:** Introduce improper fractions or mixed numbers.  Ask them to create their own equivalent fraction problems.


This lesson plan provides a flexible framework; adjust timings as needed based on student engagement and understanding.  Remember to maintain a positive and encouraging classroom atmosphere.
